<br>First, the bad news: The US unit rooster will be very limited at the start of the campaign.
<br>Now, the good news. You will have greater variety of light infantry units to recruit than European factions.
The US campaign will be very challenging!

<br>Compared to other fractions in Imperial Splendour the United States will have just one of the three eras. However, it will be split into two distinct time periods.
<br>After the the American War of Independence the Continental Army was disbanded and the regular United States army had a strength of only 1 regiment. This "early" late era will be a period where your access to regular army units will be limited. It may be advisable that you not start a war with anyone!
<br>As you developed your technology and knowledge, you will be able to recruit the Legion of the United States; a well trained army capable of fighting in open terrain and along the American frontier.
<br>Furthermore, you will have historical generals like Nathanael Green, Anthony Wayne and Arthur St. Clair.

<br>Government:

<br>At start of the campaign you have access to the historical government of the United States:

<br>The United States will have their own army and philosophy techtrees to represent the unique development of the United States during the late 18 century.

<br>Philosophy tech-tree:
<br>The Philosophy Techtree is divided into 4 different parts. At first there is the scientific advance like "Learned Society". The 2nd part are general political ideas like the "Federal System" and consequently the 3rd the acts to transform the ideas into laws and politics. Finally the 4th are economic ideas and measures.
